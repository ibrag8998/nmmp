# About

This is repo where I want to store all my completed
college tasks on subject "numerical programming and
mathematical programming"
Each directory is a task with solution and README.md

> Why no clean code?

I just need to write in my notebook every single step,
and for now I don't know how to do it with clean code,
so only in this repo I use rule "It works, no matter why"
